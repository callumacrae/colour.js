# colour.js #

colour.js is a small colour manipulation library built in JavaScript.


Use color.min.js if you're American, or use colour.min.js if you're normal. Minifed
files are both generated using the YUI compressor, with maximum settings
enabled; code is obfuscated, excess semi-colons are removed, and micro-
optimisations are made.
